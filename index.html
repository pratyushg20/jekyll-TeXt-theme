        <p>Programming Club (or PClub) is a community of students highly enthusiastic about coding, ethical hacking, 
            Web Designing and all other aspects of programming. We are a team currently of 4 coordinators (pre-final year)
            and 25 secretaries (sophomores).</p>

        <p>Our Facebook group pclubiitk has grown to a massive size of 18K members, who use it as a QnA forum, 
            or to get information about activities and competitions happening in the world of Programming.</p>

        <p>We organize activities related to Development (Web Development, Open Source, Game/App Development), 
            programming contests, hackathons, Capture The Flag contests, et all. Lecture series are regularly taken 
            on algorithms, web hijacking, development, among other things.</p>

        <p>Apart from this, we also develop various applications to be used by the campus junta; like Puppy Love 
            (during valentines week), organize activities like Linux Install fest, and promote Open Source. 
            During summers, we offer a large number of projects to the first year students through our Summer Camp.</p>

        <p>Feel free to contact any of our members any time in case of any queries! We hang out on IRC at #pclub</p>

        <p>Happy Coding!</p>
